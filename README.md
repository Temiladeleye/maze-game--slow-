Created a 3-level maze game using Python and the Pygame module. 

Storyline:

Fo Rager is the best treasure hunter the world has ever known. A young prodigy, there is no journey too precarious or risk too great for the famed captain. But even Rager is wary of *Labyrinthus nullis reditus*, an island so dangerous that no ship has ever returned from its shores. But Rager may have no choice. With only one week to pay off his gambling debts, Rager and his crew must navigate their way through the islandâ€™s maze braving ghosts, demons, and monsters in search of five golden stars and the elusive golden key.
